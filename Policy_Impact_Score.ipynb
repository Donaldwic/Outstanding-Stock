        "# Policy Impact Score (PIS)\n",
        "The Policy Impact Score (PIS) is a quantitative metric designed to measure the sensitivity of a stock or sector's returns to government policy changes. By examining the statistical relationship between policy factors and stock returns, the PIS helps investors assess which assets may be most affected by regulatory, interest rate, and policy announcement changes. The PIS uses a multi-factor regression approach, isolating specific policy-related factors that drive returns in the market.\n",
        "\n",
        "Multi-Factor Regression Model for Policy Impact\n",
        "To calculate the Policy Impact Score, we define a regression model where returns are regressed on policy-related factors. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$𝑅_𝑡=𝛼+𝛽_1𝐹_{1,𝑡}+𝛽_2𝐹_{2,𝑡}+𝛽_3𝐹_{3,𝑡}+𝜖_𝑡$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $𝑅_t$​ : Return of a stock or sector at time $𝑡$\n",
        "\n",
        "* $𝛼$ : Intercept term, representing the baseline return unaffected by policy events.\n",
        "* $𝛽_1,𝛽_2,𝛽_3$ : Coefficients that measure sensitivity to policy factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "* $F_{1,t}​,F_{2,t}​,F_{3,t}$: Policy factors that can affect to stock price\n",
        "\n",
        "* $𝜖_𝑡$​ : Error term, representing random variations in returns not explained by policy factors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Each $β_i$​ coefficient provides insight into the stock’s or sector’s exposure to a specific type of policy. We estimate these coefficients through regression analysis on historical data, where policy factors are dummy variables or quantitative measures (e.g., using values of 0 or 1 depending on the presence of a policy event, or larger values if more significant events occur).\n",
        "\n",
        "Calculating the Policy Impact Score (PIS)\n",
        "The Policy Impact Score itself is constructed as a weighted sum of the absolute values of these sensitivity coefficients, denoting the aggregate impact of policy on returns:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$PIS=𝑤_1∣𝛽_1∣+𝑤_2∣𝛽_2∣+𝑤_3∣𝛽_3∣$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "\n",
        "* $𝑤_1,𝑤_2,𝑤_3$ : Weights assigned to each policy factor, representing the relative importance or prevalence of each factor in the sector.\n",
        "\n",
        "* $∣𝛽_𝑖∣$ : Absolute value of each coefficient, representing the magnitude of impact without regard to direction.\n",
        "The weights $𝑤_𝑖$ are chosen based on either historical relevance or industry sensitivity to each policy type. By taking the absolute values of the $𝛽_𝑖$ terms, we focus on the intensity of the impact rather than its direction (positive or negative).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation and Use of the PIS\n",
        "* High PIS: A higher PIS indicates that the stock or sector is highly sensitive to policy changes, suggesting a higher likelihood of significant returns (or risks) in response to new policies.\n",
        "* Low PIS: A lower PIS suggests reduced sensitivity, meaning the stock or sector is relatively insulated from policy fluctuations.\n",
        "Example Calculation\n",
        "Assume that for a particular stock, we estimate the following coefficients and assign these weights:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$𝛽_1=1.0,𝛽_2=−0.6,𝛽_3=1.5,𝑤_1=0.5,𝑤_2=0.2,𝑤_3=0.3$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The Policy Impact Score would be calculated as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$PIS=0.5× ∣1.0∣+0.2× ∣−0.6∣+ 0.3×∣1.5∣=1.07$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This score of $1.07$ quantifies the stock’s overall sensitivity to policy events. Higher scores indicate greater exposure, allowing investors to assess risks and opportunities arising from policy-related market shifts."
